            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
            The MACD is a tool used by quantitative analysts to gauge market trends.
            It involves comparing the differential between a two-week and month-long moving average.
            Whether or not the MACD can actually predict future movement is debated, but the fact that some
            analysts use it often makes it a self-fulfilling prophecy. If enough investors base their decisions on
            the oscillation of the MACD, their collective behavior can influence the underlying. For chart interpretation,
            please see this great explanation at <a href="http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_convergence_divergence_macd" target="_blank">StockCharts</a>.
